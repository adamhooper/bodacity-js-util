Bodacity JavaScript Utilities
bodacious little JavaScript gems

Author: Adam Hooper <adam@adamhooper.com>

DESCRIPTION

Here's the deal: you want to do something bodacious, and you think to yourself,
"some other bodacious person must have wanted to do this." You find this little
collection of utilities, and one of them does exactly what you want.

So you use it: hassle-free, license-free. You can even ask me for support and
I'll probably respond sometime.

CONTENTS

* canonical_url.js: transforms any URL (potentially relative) into an absolute
                    URL, free of "../" path components.
* channeler.js: wraps jQuery's $.ajax() so that subsequent requests cancel
                earlier ones and event handlers can be registered independently.
* jquery.excerpt.js: trims a block-level element's text content to fit a
                     set number of lines.
* utf8.js: presents a String as an Array of Numbers representing utf-8 bytes.
